## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- How to use arguments passed to your program.
- What are the two prototypes of `main` that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other?
- How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters.

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- You are not allowed to use global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`.
- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file.
- You are allowed to use the standard library.

## Compilation

To compile your program, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o output
